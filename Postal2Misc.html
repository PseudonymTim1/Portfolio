      <u><span class="text-secondary">About:</span></u><br>One day I thought it'd be fun to recreate various stuff from Postal 2 in Unity, mainly the inventory system, so I did. Nothing 
      else to really say, I wasn't attempting to recreate the entirety of Postal 2, as some devs were already are working on that albiet in different engines, 
      and I don't see much of a point to persue that.
      <br>
      <br>
      ==============
      What all was recreated:
      ==============
<br>
Item pickups and pickup text feed,
full 1:1 Postal 2 inventory system (also has tips for specific items),
Bass sniffer functionality (works just like in p2 except it doesn't actually have a render texture or anything, it's a static image so it doesn't actually SNIFF),
Kevlar armor mechanic (Works just like armor does in Postal 2),
Map screen UI functionality,
Wanted level bar UI functionality,
Dude injuring and HUD hurt flashing (Works sorta like it does in Postal 2, the lower your health when you get hurt the more visible the skull and the redder the screen)
