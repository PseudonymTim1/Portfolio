          <u>Track name: Smooth Sailing</u>
          <br>Info: So for this track I wanted to have a loz windwaker kinda vibe
          since it's probably my favorite zelda game, I used pretty much just a single 
          fake earthbound soundfont to create this pretty chill track.

          <u>Track name: Electric Chair Rodeo</u>
          <br>Info: So for this track Initially I wanted to create a pretty guitar heavy epic boss battle esque track, but after showing my way more music savvy friend the finished track and talking about it 
          he told me it sounded a bit... boring, a sentiment in which I agreed with. He basically kinda overhauled the track, mixing and mastering it 
          properly and making it sound more orchestral, which I loved and only made it more epic, and I think worked way better then what I was going for. (Thanks Greg you are epic!)

          <u>Track name: Go To Hell</u>
          <br>Info: Uh I just wanted to create something with FL studio's GMS stock plugin and 
          some sick beats pretty much. Kinda wanted it to sound like something that would play when some british guy is just strolling around hell with a teacup in one hand
          and a shotgun in the other taking out demons effortlessly. Don't know what else to say about it honestly...

          <u>Track name: Youth</u>
          <br>Info: So I wanted to make a track inspired by Gharam Kartna's very dreamy weird style since 
          I'm a big fan of his music, so I did. That's pretty much it really. (Fun fact, I sampled the beginning and end audioclips from
          a bill nye youtube poop video and edited it a bit, something Gharam has done in his tracks a lot).

          <u>Track name: The Bees Knees</u>
          <br>Info: Since my main inspiration to get into music was mostly because of Austin (The guy behind lisa the painful rpg),
          I decided to make a LISA-esque battle track, you'll come to find that a lot of my music is similar to his actually...

          <br>Info: Wanted this to feel very tribal and like someone who has won a well fought battle,
           but at a big cost and is dying but overwhelmed with happiness still, being at peace knowing he got revenge.

          <br>Info: I made this track as a weird battle track for Unusual, and to experiment with gross beat in FL studio a bit, wanted it to
          sound really OFF, so I mixed a violin with really weird notes and heavy bass and drums

          the metal sytrus preset, fl limiter, and a not garbo hardcore preset)

          <br>Info: One of the first tracks I made, was supposed to be tooth and nail terrifying horror game chase scene music basically
          and I think I nailed it pretty well (Fun fact that scream at the beginning is actually the wilhelm scream believe it or not, just heavily distorted)
